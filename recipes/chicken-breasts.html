    <p>It's always a good idea to use a meat thermometer <br>
        when cooking meat that's at least an inch thick. <br>
        I take chicken off the grill at a little bit lower temp (155°F)<br>
         than is usually recommended for poultry, but that's because <br>
         the chicken will continue to cook for several minutes once <br>
         it's off the heat and resting. Taking the chicken off the heat <br>
          at this temperature helps insure that the meat doesn't overcook <br>
          and get dried out. If you feel more comfortable taking the chicken <br>
          off the heat at a higher internal temperature, please feel free to do so.</p>

        <br></br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <b>For the brine:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (33 g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, or 1 1/2 tablespoons (33 g) fine sea salt</li>
        </ul>
        <b>For the chicken:</b>
        <ul>  
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (plus more for the grill)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        </ul>     
        
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Brine the chicken breast:</li>
            <p>In a large bowl, whisk the salt in the water to dissolve. 
                Add the chicken breasts to the brine. Put in the refrigerator and chill for 30 minutes.</p>
            <li>Prepare your grill:</li>
            <p>Arrange your grill so that one side is for high direct heat, and the other side is cooler. 
                Alternatively, you can use a grill pan, set over medium-high heat.</p>
            <li>Coat the chicken with oil and paprika:</li>
            <p>Remove chicken breasts from brine and pat dry. Coat with olive oil, 
                and sprinkle evenly with paprika.</p>
            <li>Grill the chicken breasts:</li>
            <p>Brush some olive oil on the grill grates. Place chicken breasts on the hot side of the grill (or on the grill pan). Let the chicken grill, undisturbed, until the pieces start getting some grill marks (you can lift up one to check).

                When the chicken pieces have browned on one side, turn them over, and move them to the cooler side of the grill (low heat, not no heat). Cover, and let them finish cooking.
                
                Remove chicken from grill when the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 155°F.</p>
            <li>Rest the chicken breasts, then serve:</li>
            <p>Cover the breasts with foil. The chicken will continue to cook in its residual heat while it rests. Let it rest 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</p>
